# Introduction

[MisoDoc](https://github.com/juliendehos/misodoc) is a web app that renders
MarkDown files. It is inspired by
[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) and it supports the
[CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) format with a few extensions.

MisoDoc is written in Haskell using the [miso](https://haskell-miso.org/) and
[commonmark](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/commonmark) libraries.
