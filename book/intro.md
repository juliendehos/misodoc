# Introduction

[MisoDoc](https://github.com/juliendehos/misodoc) is a web app that renders
MarkDown files. It supports the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)
specification and a few extensions.

MisoDoc is written in Haskell using the [miso](https://haskell-miso.org/) and
[commonmark](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/commonmark) libraries. It is
inspired by [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).
