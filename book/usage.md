## How to use MisoDoc?

Don't.

MisoDoc dynamically renders static MD files, which is probably never a good
idea. :sweat_smile:

However, if you really want to use it, you have to:

- build the web app (see the [github
  repo](https://github.com/juliendehos/misodoc));

- write your MD files in the `book` folder (with a `summary.md` file, linking
  the other files);

- deploy everything in a `public` folder and run a HTTP server.

## What's in the web app?

Well, you are using it, actually. :scream:

On the left side, you have the summary, where you can choose the file to
render, on the right side. You also have two links, at the bottom of the page,
to go to the previous/next page.

Finally, at the top of the page, you can click on the first icon to show/hide
the summary. There is also a second icon but you probably don't want to use it.
You've been warned.
